# dont ask how it works

I have no idea. ðŸ¤·
This is my first time making a discord bot in python, through alot of trial and error, I ended up with this, it works (hopefully) and thats enough for me.

## for personal use

I dunno

## example `.env`

```plaintext
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=""
SAVE_PATH="./resources.json"
SETTINGS_PATH="./guild_settings.json"
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=""
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=""
CLOUDFLARE_NAMESPACE_ID=""
```
